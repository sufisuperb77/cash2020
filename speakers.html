	<strong>Title:</strong><u>Resilient Humanized Computational Intelligence and Humanized Technology in health Technology applications</u><br><br>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong>
	The talk will introduce the problems associated with the health technology applications based on computational intelligence and will emphasis on the resilient and realism of using computational intelligence and possible realistic machine learning.
	It will cover bio signal processing and pattern recognition; it will highlight on the EMG based driven systems. It will include a novel working myoelectric controller for a hand rehabilitation device that can deal with such issues. The proposed systems are based on computational intelligence techniques that included developing an accurate myoelectric pattern recognition which can work well in amputee and non-amputee subjects and enable amputees wearing powered prostheses to achieve functional mobility, and a novel classifiers for acquiring practical, fast and powerful methods to classify finger movements using two EMG channels. It will also cover image pattern recognition for skin cancer and the realism approach.

<strong>Title:</strong><u>Big data features, applications, and analytics in cardiology- a systematic literature review</u><br><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
In today’s digital world, information surges with the widespread use of the internet and global communication systems. Healthcare systems are also facing digital transformations with the enhancement in the utilization of healthcare information systems, electronic records in medical, wearable, smart devices, handheld devices, and so on. A bulk of data is produced from these digital transformations. The recent increase in medical big data and the development of computational techniques in the field of cardiology enables researchers and practitioners to extract and visualize medical big data in a new spectrum. The role of medical big data in cardiology becomes a challenging task. Early decision making in cardiac healthcare systems has massive potential for dropping the cost of care, refining quality of care, and reducing waste and error. Therefore, to facilitate this process a detailed report of the existing literature will be feasible to help the doctors and practitioners in decision making for the purpose of identifying and treating cardiac diseases. This detailed study will summarize results from the existing literature on big data in the field cardiac disease. This research uses the systematic literature protocol. The data was collected from the published materials for the last 10 years as conference or journal publications, books, magazines and other online sources. 190 papers were included relying on the defined inclusion, exclusion, and checking the quality criteria. The current study helped to identify medical big data features, the application of medical big data, and the analytics of the big data in cardiology. The results of the proposed research shows that several studies exist that are associated with medical big data specifically to cardiology. This research summarizes and organizes the existing literature based on the defined keywords and research questions. The analysis will help doctors to make more authentic decisions, which ultimately will help to use the study as evidence for treating patients with heart related diseases.

<strong>Title:</strong><u>Virtual Reality and Gamification Trend and Application in Sports </u><br><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
Among the primary technology of the 4th Industrial Revolution are Virtual Reality (VR). The technology has already reached the consumer with the mature development of software and hardware. Besides that, contents and data play important and significant role to boost the future lifestyle including sports. The growth of contents contributed by technology users will lead to how they will benefits from the technology for their lifestyle. Although Virtual Reality was seen as technologies reserved for gamers, many have realized the significant potential in a wide range of industries and applying the technologies to more serious matter such as sports. Gamification always been used as motivation method for athelete as well as ordinary user throughout the physical activity and provide a set of rules to encourage for better performance. This talk will include trends and applications of Virtual Reality and Gamification in Sports. Samples will be taken from research carried out at Institute of Human Centered Engineering (iHumEn), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and other renowned related research centres worldwide. Specifically, the research and development work of in Virtual Reality and Gamification conducted by our team will be exposed. Furthermore, generality of impacts with VR and gamification in sports will be highlighted.
